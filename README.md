### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Denis from Slovenia and I am a Computer Science student. I love building web applications using popular front-end framerworks such as React and Vue.js, as well as working on the backend mostly with Express (Node.js) and MongoDB. I also like to learn new skills to improve my programming knowledge overall.
